  <h1>Our Mission and Philosophy</h1>
  <h3 id="since-1998">Since 1998</h3>
<p>A family business based on trust, knowledge, and integrity...</p>
<p>Our mission at Wunderdog is to strengthen and improve the relationship between dog and owner. With a better understanding of innate dog behavior, both owner and dog will benefit, and Wunderdog strives to teach this to our clients in a way that everyone can understand.</p>
<p>Whether our clients have chosen grooming, training, extended care, in home routine and specialized visits, or daycamp, we have provided these services with instruction and insight. We don&#39;t just offer training to the adults, we offer training to all members of the family - children included (at no extra charge)! Because at Wunderdog, we are readily attending (and receiving CEU&#39;s where available) the latest educational seminars and classes in Grooming and Canine Behavior (and also maintain professional-level membership of many accredited canine organizations), we offer many types of training - including the most currently used methods.</p>
<p>We offer breed-selection services to clients who are trying to decide on the breed best suited for their lifestyle and family. Because it is our mission to improve the lives of both owners and their canine companions, we feel this is a necessary service and have had great success in our recommendations.
﻿</p>
<h3 id="wunderdog-s-philosophy">WUNDERDOG&#39;S PHILOSOPHY</h3>
<p>Our philosophy at Wunderdog is based on the humane treatment of animals. It is our belief that all animals deserve respect, and a loving touch. At Wunderdog, your dog will feel like he/she is part of the family, and not just another visitor. Because we are well-trained in the areas of animal behavior and training, Wunderdog continues to have success in the extended stay, day camp and training programs. It is our belief that you can never be too careful with an animal&#39;s safety, and we take the necessary precautions when placing animals together, etc.</p>
<p>We believe in using most training devices, as long as they are used in an efficient, positive, and healthy manner. We do research and explore the benefits or adverse (physical and mental) effects of different training devices, and offer our knowledge/experience to our clients as well as the ordering of particular devices at reasonable costs.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p>
