    <p>Nothing brings more to the table when I first meet with a new client than crate training. Most humans view crating as a &quot;prison,&quot; or consider it cruel to confine a puppy or dog.</p>
<p>Crate training is a necessity. It a way to teach your dog to have self-restraint (holding his &quot;potty&quot;), it offers structure by creating a routine, it gives the dog a place that he can feel comfortable (consider like a bedroom), and offers you and the dog a &quot;retreat&quot; should things get chaotic in the home. A crate also encourages a pup or dog&#39;s personal cleanliness.</p>
<p>In the wild, canines have a natural &quot;order&quot; to their pack; a hierarchy system that works for them. They are content because they live in a very structured environment. They are productive (hunting, etc.) because they have &quot;order.&quot; Their &quot;crate&quot; is their cave--it represents safety and solitude. A crate, used properly in the home, offers a dog more structure, more safety, and yes--you guessed it--more solitude.</p>
<p>We, as humans, do not understand their &quot;system&quot; (unless we choose to learn about it). Because there is a communication-gap between our dogs and ourselves (think of it as being in a home where you do not understand the language being spoken and you have to rely on hand and facial/mouth gestures), we have a responsibility to our pets to try and communicate better with them, and provide them an atmosphere that is conducive to what makes the most sense to them and most comfortable. I am not talking about fluffy beds and meat scraps--I am talking about giving them clear and concise &quot;household rules,&quot; and being fair and equitable in doing so. A crate is just a small help in this regard.</p>
<p>By crate training your dog, you are giving him/her the best gift you possibly can as a human! It will ease them into transitional periods such as vacationing, boarding, grooming, vet stays, etc. As humans, we need to understand that there will come a time when we will need to be away from our dog(s). Do you want the responsibility of creating a neurotic dog who cannot be away from you and will make him/herself physically sick because he/she cannot &quot;settle&quot; without you? Think about that... before you &quot;humanize&quot; your dog to the point of making him/her miserable without you, consider this sensible tool. Do your pup a favor and learn more.</p>
<p>Remember, a crate is not something to be &quot;abused,&quot; and I do not advocate crating for extended periods of time. Use it for training, safety, and practical purposes.</p>
