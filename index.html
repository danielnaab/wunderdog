    <h2>Winter Wolf Ecology Workshop 2014</h2>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p>Feb 1, 2014</p>
    <p>
        <p>February in northern Wisconsin is not most couple&#39;s idea of a &quot;getaway.&quot; But, if you are Lynn and Peter (Wunderli), you might beg to differ!</p>
<p>Both Peter and I share a love for outdoor winter sports, and have a great respect and enthusiasm about protection of our natural resources. Couple these reasons with my interest in innate dog behavior (and Peter&#39;s support of this), made signing up for TWIN&#39;s (<a href="http://www.timberwolfinformation.org">Timber Wolf Information Network</a>) workshop on Wolf Ecology an easy choice!</p>
<p>Before moving to Wisconsin, we did informal tracking of coyotes in New Hampshire. I had always yearned for more... unfortunately, the prospect of wolf tracking was never an option in New England (they have been exterminated), so when t...

    <h2>In The News...</h2>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p>Jul 14, 2012</p>
    <p>
        <p>Lynn presented &quot;CBADDC&quot; (Canine Behavior and Doggie Day Care) at the popular New England Pet Grooming Professionals (NEPGP) Summerfest in Warwick, RI on July 14, 2012. While attending and presenting, Lynn was taken by surprise to find out her clients, had voted her TOP DOG in NEPGP&#39;s annual contest (derived soley from client voting)! It was a great honor and testimonial to Wunderdog! Lynn wishes to THANK each and every one of her Wunderdog families for taking the time to vote and making her feel incredibly loved and valued!</p>

    <h2>Gilda The Great Book Update!</h2>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p>May 1, 2012</p>
    <p>
        <p>As most of our clients have already heard, Lynn and her daughter Laney (an artist/illustrator/animator/videographer) have started their first book about &quot;Gilda,&quot; the sweet little character Laney rescued from a shelter out west. Laney has begun the illustrations, and we are hoping to complete the book in 2013.</p>
<p>The book will center around Gilda&#39;s start in her new life with &quot;Ida Mae McDougal,&quot; a elderly ranch owner in Sante Fe, NM. Special little Gilda will be named &quot;Gilda Rose McDougal&quot; for unique reasons by Ida Mae. What is even more interesting is that the book is based on the true story of Gilda&#39;s rescue (a cause near-and-dear to all of our hearts!).</p>
<p>STAY TUNED for sneak peeks, pictures and progress-updates!</p>
