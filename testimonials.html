Angie went from being a scared defensive dog who knew life as a dog in a shelter. Then by chance, one look of a picture on the internet, her life changed. I will never forget the first time we met Lynn at our home to start the process of making life better for all of us; Lynn was the dog whisperer this family needed. By fortunate circumstances our next rescue, Winston, was placed in the loving hands of Lynn (through PAWS New England) and somehow she knew he would be a good fit to expand our family.</p><p>There just aren&#39;t enough words to begin to express our deepest gratitude for what Lynn has done for us and our beloved pets (including Rocky our cat!).</p><p>The love Lynn has given our pets is from her heart, and her acts of kindness and compassion are intrinsic which many of us inspire. Lynn will always be our TOP DOG!</p><ul><li>Karen and Kelly W.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-sue-m"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/sue-m.jpg" alt="Sue M."><h2>Chelsea</h2><h3>Puppy training, in-home rehab services</h3><p>I have a yellow lab named Chelsea that I enrolled in Lynn&#39;s (doggie) camp at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time, Chelsea has attended day camp two days a week for play, socialization, and training. Also during this time I have boarded Chelsea there while traveling, had her groomed, and had in-house assistance while she recovered from surgery. In short, I have used all the services offered by Wunderdog. In my years of having dogs and going to other facilities, I can honestly say this is the VERY BEST I HAVE SEEN. Lynn and her team are totally dedicated to the care and health of the dogs at camp, and her skill and experience leads to a very happy, safe, and caring environment for them. Chelsea eagerly jumps out of the car to get with her friends each time I bring her to camp!</p><ul><li>Sue M.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-mary-and-rusty-r"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/mary-and-rusty-r.jpg" alt="Mary and Rusty R."><h2>Nash</h2><h3>Puppy training, adolescent-to-adult training</h3><p>We&#39;ve had the opportunity to see first-hand Lynn&#39;s excellent training with Nash, our 6-year old lab mix, and most recently our 15-month shepard mix, Tex. Lynn exceeded our expectations. Lynn has been a terrific coach and resource for us as a family.</p><ul><li>Mary and Rusty R.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-gina-and-bruce-a"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/gina-and-bruce-a.jpg" alt="Gina and Bruce A."><h2>Petey</h2><h3>Physical &amp; mental rehabilitation, re-home</h3><p>It is with great and whole-hearted confidence that I recommend Lynn Wunderli and her dog training and dog care services. Over the last 8 years, Lynn has provided tremendous leadership, compassion and skill both in taking care of our 3 dogs over this extended period of time as well as helping us become much better canine parents. Lynn is highly passionate about the care and well-being of all dogs she has the opportunity to work with, as is testament by how excited dogs are to be in her magnetic presence. She is also dedicated to continually learning all she can about canine care, health and behavior issues. She is a tremendous resource not only for her excellent services but also for her advice and insights as well. Over the years we have trained with Lynn, entrusted her with daycare, boarding and grooming services, as well as followed her advice with regards to a number of more complex issues such as breeding, adopting rescue dogs as well as understanding canine behavior issues. We believe all individuals and dogs who work with her will so greatly benefit from her work.</p><ul><li>Gina and Bruce A.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-diane-and-jack"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/diane-and-jack-h.jpg" alt="Diane and Jack"><h2>Sassy</h2><h3>Fear, aggression, lack of leadership</h3><p>We have a 17 month old Saint Bernard. She had a VERY bad experience with a vet at 5 months of age. It had gotten to the point where she would not let anyone touch her ears or her nails--she would snap at us is we tried either of these with her. We went to a new vet who suggested we give Lynn a call. We did, and it was the right decision.</p><p>Lynn came to our house and evaluated our girl. From Lynn&#39;s evaluation we learned that she was only defending herself after being traumatized, and thought we were gong to hurt her. Lynn started the training process with us, and taught us how to work with her without scaring her and becoming her pack leaders so that she could trust us more. Lynn suggested her day camp for safe socialization and so that she could continue working on her desensitization of her ears, nails, and trust issues. During this time, we had our follow up consultations and continued our work at home.</p><p>In a couple of months the snapping stopped. The dogs trust Lynn and she has unlimited patience with them; Lynn understands dog behavior and can put her finger on why they do things and how to stop negative or dangerous behaviors.</p><p>Our girl is a whole different dog now. We can clean her ears ourselves, she no longer gets ear infections, and we can take her to vets without a problem. The vet staff says she is a different dog! They can examine her and give her shots without sedating her anymore.</p><p>Wunderdog is always SPOTLESS! The dogs go for long walks, and get plenty of play time and rest periods. Lynn always keeps both eyes on all the dogs, and communicates everything with us to make sure that we can address any issues before they become problems.</p><p>When I decided to add another dog to our home recently, Lynn suggested we rescue. She has worked with many rescue dogs, and we trust her judgment. She helped us select one from PAWS New England. She generously brought our selection home to her house to foster and evaluate her. It was good because my husband, our St. Bernard, and myself could meet her and spend time with her and make sure she was a good fit for our family. I worked out great. Lynn was a tremendous help with the whole thing.</p><p>I would recommend Lynn to anyone. I don&#39;t know where we would be if she hadn&#39;t come into our lives.</p><ul><li>Diane and Jack</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-joanne-and-paul"><p>We&#39;ve had many wunderful experiences with Wunderdog. We have been on several vacations in the past few years and wouldn&#39;t think of leaving our babies with anyone else. It is such a great atmosphere and both Maggie and Rosie are right at home. I would recommend Wunderdog to anyone, and I have. All of our friends also use Wunderdog and have been very happy. Thanks Lynn for making a great place for our babies!</p><ul><li>JoAnne &amp; Paul</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-dennis-and-kim-rusch"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/dennis-and-kim-rusch.jpg" alt="Dennis &amp; Kim Rusch"><p>My wife and I had never been dog owners before we found Nadia, a Siberian Husky, who we love very much. So as you can imagine we wanted to have a safe setting to take Nadia during the day while we worked. But it is so much more than that. At Wunderdog we met Lynn and her family and have made a lasting friendship and a second home for Nadia.</p><p>From Nadia&#39;s point of view this experience is one that she looks forward to as often as possible. Wunderdog offers us a worry-free, playful atmosphere and great socialization for our dog. In addition, we can receive personal training to develop Nadia&#39;s obedience skills, or have her groomed while she is at daycare.</p><p>Wunderdog is more than just daycare... it is care from people who have a true passion for improving the quality of life for our family pet. We are so pleased with how our dog is treated and how well she responds to attending daycare and the benefits of having a more social, well mannered dog; we can&#39;t imagine not taking Nadia to see her friends at daycare.</p><p>My wife and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you for giving us peace-of-mind knowing our dog is safe and well cared for while she is in Wunderdog&#39;s care.</p><p>Thank you.</p><ul><li>Dennis &amp; Kim Rusch</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-hampstead-animal-hospital"><p>We are writing on behalf of Lynn Wunderli and Wunderdog K-9 Care &amp; Training, LLC. We have been working closely with Lynn over the last year and have created a wonderful relationship. Her knowledge, training skills, and one-on-one consults have been an asset to our patients and our hospital. We are a multi-doctor practice that sees a large number of clients with pets in need of direction, training and behavior modification plans. Our referrals to Lynn have been very successful and we have seen a dramatic improvement in these pets following a behavior modification plan created by Wunderdog.</p><p>Lynn has excellent communication skills, is extremely organized, and very reliable. The client feedback from her is outstanding and the pet&#39;s behavior is proof of her dedication and hard work. Along with her client interactions, she also was willing to share her knowledge with our hospital staff. She created a professional power point presentation (&quot;Canine Behavior in The Vet Hospital Setting&quot;) that was full of pertinent information, left us with client information handouts, and numerous tips to share with our clients.</p><p>It is very important to us to be able to refer our clients to someone we trust and who will be able to tailor the behavior plan for both the client and their pet. Lynn is an asset to our practice in all regards and has always treated each pet as an individual. Hampstead Animal Hospital has benefited from a partnership with her because fundamental training is essential to making our patients have a positive experience. Any hospital that is able to work with her is extremely lucky and will be pleased with her results!</p><ul><li>Michael Fraysee, DVM (Hospital Owner)</li><li>Ryan Storey, DVM (Hospital Owner)</li><li>Amy Armstrong, CVT (Technical Manager)</li><li>Natalee Davis (Client Service Manager)</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-jim-and-joanne"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/jim-and-joanne.jpg" alt="Jim and Joanne"><p>We have a dog which had severe socialization issues and separation anxiety. Lynn worked with us to deal with our dogs issues and we started sending our dog to Lynn&#39;s daycare. The results of Lynn&#39;s personalized training and daycare were amazing. She made all the difference in the world in our having a happy and social dog.</p><ul><li>Jim and Joanne</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-carmen-and-victoria"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/carmen-and-victoria-f.jpg" alt="Carmen and Victoria"><p>Lynn Wunderli has cared for our little guy for over 2 years now and she has taught he and us so much about the precious relationship between people and their pets. Lynn has a day care that is more than just a place for our dog to go. She teaches obedience and socialization skills as part of her day care process and has found a way to get each dog to not only get along with other dogs, but to also &quot;be friends.&quot; It is truly hard to describe, but imagine your dog arriving at day care and being welcomed by the other dogs as if they were all family.</p><p>Lynn believes in the health and well-being of each dog she has in her care and has them exercising as part of their day -- this can be anywhere from a hike to a swim. She ensures they rest and have fun, and watches over them as if they were all her own. When it comes to our boy, Larry, she has helped us with his uniqueness and has given us simple and successful tools/tips to train him and care for him. He is remarkable dog and we feel, in part, Lynn has helped that happen.</p><p>Whether we board Larry while on vacation, train him with Lynn, have him spend a day at day camp, or get him groomed, Lynn handles all and we have come to trust her and Larry has come to love her. She has helped many people we know and no one would argue that she is an amazing care giver and dog trainer. She runs a well-oiled operation and has a system second-to-none from the time you drop off your pet to the time you pick up!</p><p>Wunderdog is always clean and the yard is designed for fun and safety. Lynn LISTENS to you as as an owner, and communicates with you whenever your pet is in her care.</p><p>Lynn has a gift and shares it willingly and happily. Whoever works with Lynn will find what we have -- an uncommon and unmatched level of professionalism, care, and knowledge that will not only win clients over, but build a relationship that will be long lasting and rewarding.</p><ul><li>Carmen and Victoria</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-ann-b"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/ann-b.jpg" alt="Ann B."><p>I&#39;ve known Lynn (and her whole family) long before I got my Rosie, (a neurotic, Polish Lowland Sheepdog that I adopted at age 2 1/2 years). Rosie came with issues, for which Lynn has been a fabulous resource and source of great advice. In addition, Rosie looks fabulous after every grooming. Her hair is a constant challenge and Lynn has risen to the challenge. My dog looks great every time! Rosie is not a dog that can be left anywhere, but Lynn loves her, she is well treated and has adapted well to being part of the Wunderdog family.</p><ul><li>Ann B.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-kathleen-s"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/kathleen-s.jpg" alt="Kathleen S."><p>Lynn has been training and caring for my dogs for over 5 years. Lynn&#39;s expertise in animal behavior, training and grooming, has been instrumental in raising my dogs. I have relied on her for all behavioral issues (excessive barking, house training etc...). She is also a trustworthy, honest, and loving care taker of my dogs when I leave them for doggy day care or overnight boarding. I highly recommend Lynn for her dog training and grooming expertise, and/or her knowledge of caring for animals while they are away from home.</p><ul><li>Kathleen S.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-kathy-and-jon-r"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/kathy-and-jon-r.jpg" alt="Kathy and Jon R."><p>My name is Kathy Richard. My husband and I own two wonderful dogs. A Boxer, Rocky, and a German Shepherd, Dakota. We recently moved from a home with lots of space to a smaller home which does not provide adequate outdoor space. I was looking for a place to bring my dogs on a weekly basis where they could go have fun, exercise, and be socialized with other dogs. An employee of mine suggested bringing them to see Lynn at Wunderdog in NH.</p><p>My husband and I felt very welcome instantly, and as we were interviewing each other, Lynn was observing both of our dogs. When we had all of our questions answered, Lynn was able to describe our dog&#39;s personalities PERFECTLY!</p><p>Dakota has had a hard time socializing with other dogs...but Lynn worked one-on-one with him, and the transformation we have seen in Dakota has been amazing! We can now bring BOTH our dogs to a local dog park without fear o altercations with other dogs. We will be forever grateful to Lynn for this.</p><p>Wunderdog Day Camp offers so many different aspects of dog training as well as daily manners class, agility, socialization, 2.5 - 4 mile walks each day, pools in the summer, scheduled nap time, grooming, and most importantly to me, an individual plan for each of my dogs according to their needs.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine a better place for my dogs!</p><ul><li>Kathy and Jon R.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-linda-d"><p>I am the proud owner of a Bichon named Lucky who isn&#39;t so Lucky. We purchased him from a breeder a few years ago and at age one he was diagnosed with a dog form of Lupus. This means that his immune system is very low and he has extremely sensitive skin. The poor guy has patches all over him where hair will never grow back. This is leading up to the wonderful care Lynn gives to my pet. I have been bringing Lucky to Lynn for puppy play time, grooming and pet sitting when needed since he was a pup. I was so happy that I found such a qualified, caring and loving person I can rely on. I couldn&#39;t bear leaving him with just any pet store groomer or vet.I know Lucky gets special individual attention when he is with Lynn and her family.The girls absolutely adore Lucky and he is absolutely spoiled when he comes home. He is off and running with the pack the minute he hits the door and never looks back. I am so grateful to have found Lynn.</p><ul><li>Linda D.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-lori-s"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/lori-s.jpg" alt="Lori S.﻿﻿"><p>I have been taking my German Shepard puppy to Wunderdog since she was about 3 months old. She is one year now and I am so happy with the progress that she has made. Lynn and her staff have been so helpful with all aspects of Kyra&#39;s care. Lynn came to our house when we first got Kyra and spoke with our entire family, helping us to understand our new puppy&#39;s needs and behavior. She helped with potty training, crate training and obedience training. She also stressed to us the importance of socialization with other dogs, and Kyra absolutely loves going to &quot;puppy school&quot; one day a week to play with all her Wunderdog friends. I really think that if we had not been referred to Lynn, we would not have made it through this first year. We have also boarded Kyra several times and it has been a good experience for all of us. I know that Kyra would highly recommend Wunderdog to any and all of her canine friends and we totally agree!.</p><ul><li>Lori S.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-marge-l"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/marge-l.jpg" alt="Marge L."><p>My dogs have been cared for and loved by our friend Lynn Wunderli. We have boarded our dogs with Lynn for over six years. When we first began, one of our dogs was older, blind and somewhat nervous as to where she was. Lynn and her family took such great care of our little Tucket. From feeding her by hand to giving her scents to find her own way in and out of the house put our mind at ease. She became so comfortable that even at her elder stage in life would get excited to go back.</p><p>Once our Tucket passed along came another puppy. Lynn never hesitated taking our two dogs Lily and Lucie together. Lynn provided our dogs play time, walk time and quiet time with a report of their activity everyday. Her play area had many toys and a large area, which was perfect for my playful Lucie. The long walks gave our Lily her favorite exploration time.</p><p>Lynn has not only provided boarding services, but she has also given me me training lessons for my somewhat delinquent labs. Lynn is so knowledgeable, and truly understands the way to train my dogs was to actually train me! Lynn is a very patient teacher. She has given me great insight as to the dogs’ body language and why they act the way they do!</p><p>I would highly recommend Lynn Wunderli for dog training and boarding. Lynn is passionate and enjoys every aspect of her business. The true testament is the happiness of the dogs after spending time with Lynn.</p><ul><li>Marge L.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-ellie-s"><p>I would like to write a very deserving testimonial for the Wunderful Wunderdog experience. Harry beagle and I love to takes trips to Wunderdog. We love the family atmosphere and warm welcoming feeling when we arrive. The service is absolutely Wunderful and surpassed by none. Lynn and staff are so accommodating and often receive Harry on very short notice. I am so grateful to know all of the Wunderful Wonderdog family. We will love them forever!</p><ul><li>Ellie S.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-emily-a"><p>Lynn Wunderli has not only been a very good friend to me over the years, but has been a terrific surrogate mother to my dogs. I have always been confident boarding &quot;members of my family&quot; with Lynn, knowing that they would be well taken care of and loved as if they were her own. She has also been a wonderful source of knowledge in many aspects of dog training and care. I have never hesitated to recommend Wunderdog to both friends and strangers and will continue to do so in the future!</p><ul><li>Emily A.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-virginia-and-tom-e"><img src="/wunderdog/images/testimonials/virginia-and-tom-e.jpg" alt="Virginia &amp; Tom E."><p>We are delighted to be able to recommend Wunderdog of Sandown, NH, and in particular, Lynn Wunderli. Lynn came into our home to help us train our dog Albie. He was a very spirited one-year old Golden Retriever at the time, a rescue dog full of mischief with no manners at all! Thank goodness for Lynn! She helped him with basic commands and gave us the instructions we needed too! She gave us amazing tips that were tailored just for our dog and his unending energy. It has also been a pleasure to send Albie to daycare at Wunderdog once a week where he was able to play with other dogs and have some additional training. Lynn really has a way with dogs!</p><ul><li>Virginia &amp; Tom E.</li></ul></article></div></section><footer><div class="links"><div><h1>Contact Info</h1><address>Wunderdog LLC<br>P.O.
