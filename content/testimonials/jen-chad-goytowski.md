We rescued Brantley when he was 10 months old. He was a large lab with absolutely no manners! He was very mouthy, jumped on guests, chased anything from rabbits to cars, pulled on his leash and did not know how to greet other dogs. We tried a lot of different techniques on our own to try to teach him some manners, however, we weren't very successful.

We called Lynn and she was able to meet with us within a week. From our first meeting, I could tell she was a great fit for Brantley because she didn't take any of his nonsense. Lynn's 'Nothing in Life For Free' program was an eye-opener for us as well as for Brantley. After implementing the program for a few weeks, Brantley became more settled and started to relax and listen to our commands.

We also knew we wanted to train Brantley with an e-collar so we could trust him off-leash and to give him more freedom. Lynn took us through four weeks of e-collar training and now Brantley can be trusted completely off-leash. She even accompanied us to the dog park to make sure Brantley was playing nicely with the other dogs and gave us suggestions for corrections when they were needed.

At the end of our training, Brantley is a completely different dog. He's completely settled, heels on leash, no long jumps on guests and now greets and plays with other dogs properly!

Friends and family are amazing at what a good dog he has turned into. Strangers have even come up to us commenting on what a good dog he is and they wish their dog was that well behaved.

Lynn worked wonders with Brantley and we are so thankful for all of her endless knowledge she shared with us!
