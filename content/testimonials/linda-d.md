I am the proud owner of a Bichon named Lucky who isn't so Lucky. We purchased him from a breeder a few years ago and at age one he was diagnosed with a dog form of Lupus. This means that his immune system is very low and he has extremely sensitive skin. The poor guy has patches all over him where hair will never grow back. This is leading up to the wonderful care Lynn gives to my pet. I have been bringing Lucky to Lynn for puppy play time, grooming and pet sitting when needed since he was a pup. I was so happy that I found such a qualified, caring and loving person I can rely on. I couldn't bear leaving him with just any pet store groomer or vet.I know Lucky gets special individual attention when he is with Lynn and her family.The girls absolutely adore Lucky and he is absolutely spoiled when he comes home. He is off and running with the pack the minute he hits the door and never looks back. I am so grateful to have found Lynn.
