Lynn Wunderli has not only been a very good friend to me over the years, but has been a terrific surrogate mother to my dogs. I have always been confident boarding "members of my family" with Lynn, knowing that they would be well taken care of and loved as if they were her own. She has also been a wonderful source of knowledge in many aspects of dog training and care. I have never hesitated to recommend Wunderdog to both friends and strangers and will continue to do so in the future!
