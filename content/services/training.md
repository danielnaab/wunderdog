## Personal consultation fees

"GREAT BEGINNINGS/THE BASICS & FINE TUNING" INITIAL CONSULTATION:
Up to 2 hours:  $195 flat fee (after 2 hours, HOURLY RATE WILL APPLY). Includes one follow up phone call or email at no extra charge (phone call is limited to 15 minutes), and ALL FAMILY MEMBERS ARE WELCOME!

This (up to 2 hours) session is terrific for those clients with new puppies, or those with any new addition to their family wishing to start off with all the advantages!  This session covers a complete intake-evaluation, basic temperament assessment, and protocol/program. You wil learn A LOT in this session, and will receive a computer generated report within one week of the appointment.

## Behavioral modification initial consultation

Up to 2 hours:  $200 flat fee (after 2 hours, HOURLY RATE WILL APPLY).
Includes one follow up phone call or one email at no extra charge (phone is limited to 15 minutes) and ALL FAMILY MEMBERS ARE WELCOME!

This (up to 2 hours) session is for clients who are concerned with their dog's behavior(s). These clients have either been dealing with issues without resolution, or are seeing new issues--all of which are affecting their life with their dog. These issues can range from mild to severe, from obnoxious to aggressive behavior...

## Separation anxiety initial consultation

Up to 2 hours:  $250 flat fee (after 2 hours, HOURLY RATE WILL APPLY).
*Diagnosis/Prognosis to be discussed at the end of the session, and successive sessions to be outlined at that time.

Separation Anxiety (SA) is a complicated condition that cannot be modified with an "easy fix."  Therefore, diagnosis-then-prognosis/protocol/program is time-consuming and laborious for both Trainer and Owner(s). Owners/Clients MUST BE PREPARED TO COMMIT TO A MINIMUM OF 6 WEEKS, with a minimum of 1 hour per week of session training. Phone calls and emails are routinely excerised on average at least 2 to 3 times per week (at hourly rate).
WE CAN HELP FIX THE "UNFIXABLE," but only with an owner's commitment and time/energy/financial expenditures associated with treatment.

- Hourly rate: $95/HOUR (with Lynn Wunderli)
- Telephone/email/Skype rate: $45/HOUR

PACKAGES: After completing the Initial Consultation of "Great Beginnings/The Basics & Fine Tuning," clients can ADD follow up packages to help save time and money!

## Follow-up bundles
- 3 One-Hour Sessions = $240 (Save $45!)
